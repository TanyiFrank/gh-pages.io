            <h1>ROBOTS.TXT</h1>
            <h3>What is robots.txt?</h3>
        </header>

        <p>
            Robots.txt is a text file webmasters use to instruct web robots or search engines robots 
            how to crawl or index pages on their websites. 
           The robots.txt file is part of  the robots exclusion protocol (REP) that regulate how robots crawl the web pages,
           access,index content, and serve the content up to users. The robots exclusion protocol also includes 
           directives like meta robots, as well as  page-, subdirectory-, or site-wide instructions for
            how search engines should treat links.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, robots.txt files also specify which user-agent can or cannot crawl parts of a website. 
            Two main instructions are commmonly used that is, "allowed" and "disallowed" to specified the behavior 
            of a certain or all user-agents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>BASIC FORMAT:</h3>
            User-agent: [user-agent name] <br>
            Disallow: [URL string not to be crawled]
        </p>
        <p>
            The two lines above are considered a complete robots.txt file even though
            one robots.txt file can contain multiple lines of user agents and directives such as disallows, allows,
            crawl-delays, etc.
            Within a robots.txt file, each set of user-agent directives appear as a discrete
            set, separated by a line break:
            <br>
            <p><img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Exam-one\images\rb.png"> </p>
            <br>
            In a robots.txt file with multiple user-agent directives,
            each disallow or allow rule only applies to the useragent(s) specified in that particular line
            break-separated set. If the file contains a rule that applies to more than one user-agent, a crawler
            will only pay attention to (and follow the directives in)
            the most specific group of instructions.

                    <h3>What is Human.txt</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is interesting to know the people behind a website. Thus human.txt
                        file  is a file that contains information about the different people
                        who have contributed to the building of a website. </p>
                    <h3>Why a TXT?</h3>
                    <p>Because it's something simple and fast to create. That is,it's not intrusive
                        with the code. More often than not, the owners of the site don't like the authors signing
                        it; they claim that doing so may make the site less efficient. By adding a txt file, you can
                        prove your authorship (not your property) in an external,
                        fast, easy and accessible way.</p>

                <h2>Open Graph</h2>

                <p>Open Graph is a technology first introduced by Facebook in 2010 that allows
                    integration between Facebook and its user data and a website. By integrating Open Graph meta tags
                    into a page content,  one can identify which elements of that
                    page want to be shown when someone share's that page.</p>
                <p> For example, you could use the og:image tag to specify what image you want Facebook to use when
                    your page is shared. By specifying Open Graph information, such that 
                    Facebook doesn't have to guess what information to use when your page is shared.</p>

                    <h3>Example of Open Graph meta tags</h3>
                    <p>
                      Below is an example of how Open Graph meta tags appear on web pages and how it could be used.
                      Open Graph meta tags are similar to HTML meta tags except for the fact that Open Graph has the property 
                      attribute which is absent in HTML tags 
                     </p>

                </aside>
                <p>
                    <h3>How to add Open Graph meta tags</h3>

                   Just Like other meta tags, the Open Graph tags must be place in the head of an HTML page such that if any modification 
                    is done on the HTML, these tags can by added using any HTML editor or using a CMS like
                    WordPress to manage these tags.
                </p>
                <h3>Overview of Open Graph meta tags</h3>

                <h2>Why is it important to separated CSS-Layout from HTML-Content? </h2>

                <p> For Efficiency of code: The larger your files are, the longer they will take to download, and the more
                    they will cost some people to view Y
                    therefore don’t want to waste your bandwidth on large pages cluttered up with styling and layout
                    information in every HTML file. A much better alternative is to make the HTML files stripped down
                    and neat, and include the styling and layout information just once in a separate CSS file. 
                   </p>
                
                   <p>For easy  maintenance: having the HTML separated from the CSS file makes it easy to update information 
                  separated. instead of srolling up and down a very large file looking for an error to fixed which can be easily 
                   fixed if the two pages are separated.
                     .</p>

                 <p> Accessibility: Web users who are visually impaired can use a piece of software known as a “screen
                    reader” to access the information through sound rather than sight — it literally reads the page out
                    to them, and it can do a much better job of helping people to find their way around your web page
                    if it has a proper semantic structure, such as headings and paragraphs. 
                 .</p>

          
                <p>Web crawlers or search engines:  A search engine uses  “crawler”, which is a specialized piece of 
                    software, to read through web pages. If the crawler
                    has trouble finding the content of your pages, or mis-interprets what’s important because you
                    haven’t defined headings as headings and so on, then your rankings in relevant search results will
                    probably suffer.</p>
